House Escape is a console game in which the player must read for days and
have a lot of imagination in order to complete it. The game is fully
developed, tested and approved from me. The code is a mess so have a fun time
hacking/modding. Probably this is the first and last version of the
game so every bug is a feature. Have fun playing!

basement = '''
You find yourself in a cold and dirty basement. The first thing you see
is a skeleton of a man resting on a wall. Scared you step back to feel only 
the wet wall. Naturaly you look for an exit. There is a metal door at the
opposite end of the room.
'''
bright_room = '''
You enter a very bright room. Blinded you try to get used to the burning light
...finaly able to see you inspect the room. There is a drawer, a radio and a
door. 'How I got here anyway' you ask yourself. Then you realise something-
there are no windows in the room.
'''
radio_tape1 = '''
As you approach the radio it suddenly truns on:
'Hello there! I am your guide for the riddle in the next room
so you better keep listening. What is the difference between you
and the skeleton downstares? You see? Simple. Good luck!..'
'''
shady_room = '''
You enter a shady room with only one lamp at a table to light the place. There
are paintings on the wall all featuring very dark images. You feel disturbed.
Stating to get used to lighting you see a couch plased at the west side of the
room. There is a brown door across the room. Next to it you see box like object
on the wall.
'''
library_room = '''
You find yourself in a library like room. There is one big bookshelf and a
table with a lamp on it just like in the shady room but this time there are 4
chairs around it. A green box on the floor near the table grabs your attention.
'It's just like in the shady room but this time is green'. There is a green door
too.You already know what to.
'''

barby_girl_room = '''
Entering the room the only color you see is pink. You find yourself in a barby
girl room. For few seconds you stand there on the entrance confused, with open
mouth. Looking in the room you see a pink drawer, a pink toy-house, a pink bed
and a pink door like the one in the basement...except pink.
'''
office_room = '''
You enter an home office type room. There is a desk, a drawer, a couch and
a chair behind the desk. On the floor you see scattered papers. It looks like
someone left in a hurry. There is a grey door in front of the desk.
'''

toilet_room = '''
As you enter you feel a disgusting smell...like in toilet...And yes as you
suspect, this room is a toilet. It strongly resebles the toilets at school.
There are 4 cabins and a box like object-the same like in the previous rooms.
Near the cabins you see a white door.
'''

bizarre_room = '''
You enter bizarre looking room. There is only a couch at the center of the
room facing the red door. As you come in, you kick a box like object. 'So
the standart setup?'-you say to yourself. There is something on the wall
...a note!
'''

bedroom = '''
You enter a yet another bedroom. The strange thing is that there is a bed
in the middle of the room. Near it there is a drawer, of course, and a desk
with a radio on it. \'So another stupid puzzle..\'-you say to yourself.
'''

radio_tape2 = '''
As you approach the radio it suddenly turns on:
'Hello and congrats on your work so far. I really am impressed that you didn't
type the exit action up until now. You must like this place a lot. Ok straight
to the point-I have no puzzle to tell you. You must already know even a part of
the password. Only hint I can give you is: collect items.'
'''

seiling = '''
You are now on the seiling floor of the house. There is a couch, a
drawer and a window in the room. The window is closed but you see
there is a ladder on the other side of the window. 'It's finaly over'-
you say to yourself.
